Esoteric is another anti-cheat made for MC:BE. Compared to Mockingbird, this has more checks
I'm deciding to not disclose to the *gernal* public.

**NOTICE: Esoteric is now currently in an experimental state - performance may degrade.
Until this notice is removed, please refrain from using future Esoteric versions on big production servers.**

## BDSX
BDSX is a software that injects into a BDS server, making BDS servers now customizable. You are able to handle packets and whatnot on it.

This branch of Esoteric abuses `async/await` (as if it was a thread) and handles packets in a queue. Some hacks are used to create custom packet wrappers, but it's fine.

## Detecions
There are currently no detections in this branch of Esoteric.
